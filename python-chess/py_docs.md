## Notes
- Monty Python Documentation
- Use '_' in python interactive mode to reference the previous result
- String Splicing: [included:excluded] or [:excluded] or [included:]
- Strings are Immutable
- Lists support slice assignment (list[2:5] = [4,3,2])
- Remember to use enumerate(list) in place of range(len(list))
- Match case can use '_' that will catch anything
- can use '|' as or for match/case statements
- can use an if statement to 'guard' a case
- when reading the documentation of functions, [] around a parameter mean it is optional
- when using Lists as a Queue, import deque from collections for fast appending and popping from both sides
